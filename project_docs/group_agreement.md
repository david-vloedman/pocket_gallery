*All* team members will substantively contribute to coding features using all three languages.

**Purpose Statement:** 
Work hard. Work well together. Create a quality Web App. Exceed even our own expectations. 

**Code of Conduct:** 
We are each responsible for the quality of our own work, and pledge to work as hard as necessary to ensure that our efforts enhance our group goals.  

**Conduct Agreements:**
 - Respect each other’s time by attending class and all meetings as scheduled and on time. 
 - Respect each other’s efforts by celebrating success, giving constructive suggestions, and offering assistance if asked.  
 - Contribute equally and distribute tasks evenly. 
 - Be transparent with any impediments or blockers that may impact our efforts goals.  
 - Identify, troubleshoot, and problem-solve as a team. 
 - Amplify creativity by welcoming and fully considering all ideas. 

**Conflict Management:**
If, at any time, we fall out of sync with this agreement or experience a conflict, we will first attempt to amicably resolve the conflict with respectful, clear, and honest communication. 

If those involved are unable to reach a resolution, we will involve the other members of the group, and seek a majority consensus. We each pledge to respect the wishes of the group majority. 

Because our team consists of 4 members, it is possible that a majority consensus cannot be reached, and in this event we agree to defer to the team member that has oversight over the defining aspect of the topic at hand. 

For any conflict that cannot be resolved according to these guidelines, we will involve an instructor to mediate as a method of last resort. 

**Workflow:** 
 - We will maintain a single repo through GitHub : 201_Final_Project.
 - All team members act as equal contributors, and will clone the initial master branch with approved scaffolding to their individual local repositories.
 - MVPS will be decomposed into coding and project oriented tasks, which will be individually assigned through Trello. 
 - Each developer will create a new feature branch titled appropriately and distinctly to the task. Branch names will all be lowercase with no spaces (use _ for any spaces).
 - Once completed, the branch will be submitted for code review and merge consideration through a pull request.
 - David will approve all merge requests. 
 - Developers agree to frequent A-C-P cycles- pushing only to their current working branch. 
 - Commits should be detailed, specific, and complete. 
 - Multiple team members are not to work separately on any one branch, task, or feature. 
 - No team member should work on a task, branch, or feature that is not one of their direct assigns.  
 - Deadlines are 7:59am the next day, unless otherwise specified within Trello or altered by group agreement. 
 - We will all pull from the master branch each morning, as a group, and after all outstanding pull requests have been assimilated.  

**Communication:**
We will communicate and share resources through a group slack channel.
We will organize tasks through Trello.  
We will host an internal check-in meeting each morning for each member to update the team on their progress on any/all tasks or deliverables. Any edits to the project plan will be made as a result of these check-ins. 
We will conclude with a reflection meeting and a final update of our Trello board. 
We will participate in daily standups with Instructors. 

**Technology and Tools:**
The Github repository will be initialized by David, with Mason, Natalie, Lindsay added as collaborators.
We will deploy our web app through Netlify
